# Sharing Brushes

After you've edited and saved a brush, it will appear in the `FocalPaint` folder under `Brushes`.  Use the Files app to find it.  At the moment brushes are named a long random string, so it might be hard to find the right brush. This will be corrected in a future release to include the name of the brush.  You could just share all the brushes (the whole Brush folder).  You might want to compress the brushes first to make it easier (Gmail App doesn't like sharding folders)

To install a brush just copy the folder (and uncompress if necessary) into the Brushes folder and they will immediately appear inside of FocalPaint.  If you don't have a FocalPaint or Brushes folder, you may need to go into FocalPaint and edit an existing brush and save it. This will create the folders you need. (This will also be corrected in a future release).

Please only accept brushes from people you trust, as brushes can include GPU Shader Code and it is very unlikely, but unknown whether this can be a security issue, or possibly crash your device.
