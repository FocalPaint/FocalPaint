# Sharing Brushes

After you've edited and saved a brush, it will appear in the `FocalPaint` folder under `Brushes`.  Use the Files app to find it.   You might want to compress the brushes first to make it easier (Gmail App doesn't like sharing folders)

To install a brush just copy the folder (and uncompress if necessary) into the `FocalPaint/Brushes` folder and they will immediately appear inside of FocalPaint.

Please only accept brushes from people you trust, as brushes can include GPU Shader Code and although very unlikely, it is unknown whether this can be a security issue, or possibly crash your device.
